Supervisor: Saeid Pourroostaei Ardakani

# Introduction

Music is developed under the mutual influence of artists from various genres. In the last ninety
years, lots of great music has been created. We develop a network model based on some advanced
algorithm to excavate the significant evolutionary and revolutionary trends of artists and genres.
This paper is categorized into the main three-part, focusing on influence, similarity and evolution, for
music genres and artists respectively.
